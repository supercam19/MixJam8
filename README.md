Dart Dungeon - Sneak around procedurally generated dungeons and take out enemies with darts, just don't forget to pick your weapons back up after! As you progress deeper in the dungeon, power up your character so that you can face progressively stronger enemies.

It's best to take out separated enemies, as when attacked, nearby enemies will come to their aid.


To progress to the next floor, clear all enemies, and destroy the crate that spawns when the last enemy dies to get a powerup and reveal a ladder down.
